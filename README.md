# Rust-key-values-database
A little rust program that stores values and keys to a file, based off Ryan Levick's livestreams from a while ago. I plan on making it able to store duplicate values by 
making them "Value name"1 or 2 or however many duplicates there are later on. Doing some python automation stuff for a bit though :)
